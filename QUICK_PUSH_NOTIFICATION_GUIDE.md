2. Browser asks for permission → Click **"Allow"**
3. Button turns green → **"Push Notifications ON"**
4. Now you'll receive notifications! 🔔

### Test in 2 Browsers:

**Browser 1 (Chrome) - Associate:**
```
1. Open Chrome → Login as Associate
2. Click "Push Notifications OFF" button
3. Browser asks: "Allow notifications?" → Click "Allow"
4. Button turns GREEN → "Push Notifications ON" ✅
5. Leave this browser open (can minimize or switch tabs)
```

**Browser 2 (Edge) - Admin:**
```
1. Open Edge → Login as Admin
2. Go to Notifications page
3. Create a notification
4. Send to the associate
```

**Expected Result:**

## ❌ Common Mistakes:

### Mistake 1: Never clicked the enable button
❌ "I created a notification but didn't receive it"
✅ **You must click the enable button first!**

### Mistake 2: Blocked notifications by accident
❌ Clicked "Block" when browser asked for permission
✅ **Fix:** Click the lock icon 🔒 in address bar → Change "Notifications" to "Allow"

### Mistake 3: Different browser
❌ Enabled in Chrome, but testing in Edge
✅ **Each browser needs to enable separately!**

### Mistake 4: Not logged in
❌ Trying to enable on citizen page without interaction
✅ **Citizen must click the floating bell button**

## 🔍 Quick Check:

**Open browser console (F12) and type:**
```javascript
Notification.permission
```

**Result should be:**
- `"granted"` ✅ - Push notifications will work!
- `"denied"` ❌ - You blocked it, need to unblock
- `"default"` ⚠️ - You haven't enabled yet

---

## 🎬 Visual Flow:

```
You (Admin) create notification
         ↓
Backend sends push to server
         ↓
Push server → Associate's browser
         ↓
Service worker receives push
         ↓
🔔 POPUP APPEARS! 🔔
```

**This ONLY works if:**
1. Associate clicked "Enable Push Notifications" ✅
2. Associate granted browser permission ✅
3. Browser/tab can be closed - still works! ✅
